                      Building Confidence with Automation Through Projects
                      <br><br>
                  </h3>

                  <p class="blog-text-two">
                    Automation once felt like an abstract concept to me — something you learn from tutorials and theory but don’t fully grasp until you actually build something real.
                    <br><br>
                    That changed when I started automating tests for my own projects. My first big step was writing automated tests for my personal blog site. This wasn’t just about practicing coding skills; it was about ensuring my blog worked correctly every time I made updates.
                    <br><br>
                    Having those automated tests in place gave me a new sense of confidence. I could push changes without the constant worry of breaking something important. If a test failed, I’d know exactly where to look and fix the problem quickly.
                    <br><br>
                    This hands-on experience showed me that automation isn’t just a checklist to tick off — it’s a powerful safety net that makes development less stressful.
                    <br><br>
                    As I built more projects, each one improved my automation skills and boosted my trust in the process. I learned how to write more robust tests, structure my test suites effectively, and integrate automation into real-world workflows.
                    <br><br>
                    Adding continuous integration pipelines to automatically run my tests on each push was a game changer. It gave me instant feedback and caught problems early — even when I wasn’t at my computer.
                    <br><br>
                    Through these projects, automation became less of a mystery and more of a dependable tool I rely on every day.
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re learning automation, I highly recommend building your own projects. The lessons you learn are priceless and will accelerate your growth far more than just following tutorials.
