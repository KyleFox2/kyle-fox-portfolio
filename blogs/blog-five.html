                      My First Time Setting Up a Pipeline
                      <br><br>
                  </h3>

                  <p class="blog-text-two">
                    Setting up my first CI/CD pipeline was a mix of excitement and confusion. I’d written automation tests locally, but getting them to run automatically on every commit felt like a huge leap.
                    <br><br>
                    I started with GitHub Actions because it’s free, well-documented, and integrates nicely with GitHub repos. But at first, my pipeline was a mess. Tests failed mysteriously, dependencies were missing, and the logs were hard to decipher.
                    <br><br>
                    It took a lot of trial and error. I learned how to write workflow files in YAML, how to install dependencies, and how to configure the environment for headless browser testing. I also discovered the importance of caching dependencies to speed up pipeline runs.
                    <br><br>
                    Gradually, my tests began passing consistently, and the pipeline started sending me email notifications when something broke. That was a major milestone.
                    <br><br>
                    Having this automated feedback loop made me feel like my automation work had leveled up. I no longer had to manually run tests or worry about changes breaking the build without me noticing.
                    <br><br>
                    Since then, CI/CD pipelines have become a standard part of my workflow. They give me peace of mind and help deliver quality code faster.
                    <br><br>
                    If you’re new to pipelines, my advice is to start simple, be patient, and learn as you go. The payoff is absolutely worth it.
